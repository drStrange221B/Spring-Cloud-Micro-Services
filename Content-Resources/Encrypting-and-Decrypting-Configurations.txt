Encrypting and Decrypting Configurations

- Property values should not be stored in plain text
- There are two types of Encryption and Decryption a) Symmetric and b) asymmetric
  - symmetric: share key
  - asymmetric: share RSA key pair. ths is going to much more secured
- spring cloud server offers /encrypt adn /decrypt endpoints. assuming these end points are secured
- alternately, there is an option to chose to decrypt on server or in the client side

how to do?
Download full-strength JCE
Add key to bootstrap file ( for symmetric )
Generate encrypted value and add to properties file
Retrieve configuration via API


test client app with server-side decrypted value
update server to require client-side decryption

change client to decrypt
